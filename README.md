### Hi there 👋

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on creative games made by me and my team members.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with designing orginal and creative games from scratch without the help of the teacher.
- 💬 Introduction: My name is Brandon Webber, I am a Junior at SWCTA who is taking apart in the digital game development field/program .
- 📫 Interests In Game Dev: Im interested in making fun and enjoyable games off my pure skill when it comes to building games.
